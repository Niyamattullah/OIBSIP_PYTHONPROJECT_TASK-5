# OIBSIP_PYTHONPROJECT_TASK-5

Project Title: Random Password Generator (Desktop GUI Application)

Overview:
        This project is a standalone desktop application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It serves the purpose of generating secure and customizable passwords for users in an intuitive and aesthetically designed interface. This application demonstrates an understanding of both core Python logic and GUI application development.

The application is structured as a single Python script that, when executed, automatically launches a visually styled pop-up window. The interface is designed with a dark purple theme, giving it a modern and professional appearance while ensuring user comfort during prolonged use.

Features:
        The core functionality revolves around generating random passwords based on user-defined criteria. Users have the option to specify the length of the password and choose whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols. One of the key features is the ability to exclude specific characters that users may find ambiguous or difficult to remember, such as '0', 'O', '1', or 'l'. This ensures higher readability without compromising security.

In addition to customization, the application provides a built-in clipboard integration. Once a password is generated, users can click the "Copy to Clipboard" button, which immediately copies the result and confirms the action with a pop-up message. Input validations are also handled smoothly to ensure users do not enter invalid values or leave all options unchecked.

Technical Stack:
                This project is built entirely using Python with the Tkinter library for GUI development. The string and random modules are used to generate characters and construct the password, while the pyperclip module is utilized for clipboard copying. The application is lightweight and requires minimal dependencies, making it easy to run on any system with Python installed.

Project Outcome:
                This project allowed me to explore user interface design, input handling, password security principles, and dynamic interaction through desktop-based applications. Unlike traditional web-based tools, this solution provides an offline utility with quick access, portability, and practical security features.
